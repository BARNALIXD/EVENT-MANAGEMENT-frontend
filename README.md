# Event Me

Static prototype for an event management and community site.

## Pages
- `index.html` — marketing homepage
- `login.html` — login only
- `signup.html` — signup only
- `events.html` — public event list
- `admin.html` — admin dashboard (CRUD)

## Demo accounts
- Admin: `admin@demo.com` / `admin123`
- User: `user@demo.com` / `user12345`

Or create your own in `login.html` (toggle "Create as admin" to make an admin).

## Data
- Stored in browser localStorage under keys: `eventme_users`, `eventme_session`, `eventme_events`.
- Replace images in `assets/images/` and icons in `assets/icons/`.

## Run
